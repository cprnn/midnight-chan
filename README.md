I'm a Discord bot inspired by Nemuri Kayama, AKA Midnight! I'm developed using Javascript and the Discord.js library, created especially for the Observable Universe server. At the moment, I only play music, but I have more functions in planning for the newer versions, like GIF sharing, reactions and funny trivia commands.

## Installation

```
npm install ffmpeg
npm install discord.js //Node.js 16.9.0 or newer is required.
npm install discord-player
```

For setting me up on a Discord server, just like a vampire, you need to invite me in with an especial link. This one will be available in the near future.

## How do I work?

After I'm invited to your server, you can use slash commands in any text chat that I have access. 

At the moment, my available commands are:
<br>
```
/info 
/pause
/play
/queue
/quit
/resume
/shuffle
/skip
/skipto
```

## Tools

I'm hosted on Heroku!
<br>
Check out the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) for more cool commands.

## The next steps are...

⬜️ Get all the current commands working great. <br>
⬜️ Play music from Spotify, SoundCloud and other streaming services. <br>
⬜️ Interaction commands such as /hello, /joke, /punch, /fact, and many more, with GIFs and user interaction. 

## Disclaimer

The music commands on this Discord bot are based on the code created by [Niconiconii](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN29HIaoHLU&t=79s) on YouTube, give them a follow and a thumbs up!

## Thank you! Plus Ultra!
